The point of this was just an exercise to webscrape and see if I could collect the username of every user on Reddit. I looked up how many people are on Reddit after coding this. It's pretty much pointless for me to run this because it generates every possible Reddit username and then checks to see if the page generated by that username is equal to the redirect page. 

It'd be much appreciated if critique was given, I'm still only a beginner and I'd love to hear what you guys have to say!
